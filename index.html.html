        <h2>Life is a constant journey of learning, there is no final destination...<br>
        As a former veterinary technician turned bootcamp disciple I have always enjoyed discovering solutions to new problems and incorporating new technologies into my life. I enjoy using HTML/CSS and jQuery to make my ideas come to life and look forward to learning new languages. 
        An animal lover at heart I have always had a strong desire to learn new technologies and utilize them into increasing medical efficiencies. I am really excited in the impact I could possibly make in the futre of both fields.
